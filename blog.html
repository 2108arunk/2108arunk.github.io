<h3>Why this website?</h3>
<p>The covid lockdown gave me much needed time to sort out my priorities, I had the luxury to truly discover my own thinking and ideologies. Away from other people's thoughts and opinions I thought in a vaccuum about where technology is taking us. I took on anexperiment to try tiling window manager on my linux machine, and i'm glad that I did that. At first I thought about the people who used tiling window managers as wannabe-eletist just for the heck of it, to look cooler, I took the leap and fast forward to august, I am using arch with bspwm on my Linux machine.
<p>It taught me a very important lesson that less is more, the abundance of technology that seems to make things earier for us ends up doing quite the opposite, I realised how easy and simple things saves time and are more efficient in the longer run, I short we all are bloating ourselves when it comes to technology, rather then adding to our abilities, it is taking a toll on us.
<p>One fine day, Luke made a video on how we all should have a personal website, and how this makes a lot more sense instead of using those so called big platforms to express ourselves, I always wanted a place where I could write whatever I want to. So here we are, at my very own personal space, free from all the framework bloat, created only using plain HTML and CSS.
