<h3>Groff is not a meme!</h3>
<p>Wanted to write an essay with good professional formatting and everything, can't even think of MS word to write and then export to pdf. So, libre office came to my mind. didn't want 
to install tons of dependencies just to make a simple formatted pdf.
<p>Latex was also in option, and is a great option indeed but this time I went with something even more minimal, so minimal and barebone that I thought it was a meme started by Luke Smith
, went ahead and wrote the essay in plain text using markup and then using groff to make a pdf out of it.
<p>I must admit, I was impressed with how good the document came out to be, I was more focused about writing the content rather than fixing the wierd formatiing issues that comes with 
complicated software usage. 10/10 Highly recommended.
<em>Minimalism is not a meme</em>

<h3>End work/study from home!! por favor.</h3>
<p>Maybe somewhere down the line reading this again, I might be laughing at my opinions, but this is what I feel at the moment. Having a brother studying through online mode, and 
myself as victim of a small scammy startup (more on this later), woking from home.
<p>Epidemiologists and scientists know better about the current state of pandemic and what effect would reopening of schools and colleges would have on the number of infected people.
But I can see all the adverse effects of this work from home scam. When we talk about all the big corporate giants and even the small ones, most of them are operating in work from home 
mode. Now this is both a boon and a bane but right now at the present state I think the employees are being the ones who are being exploited. Number one, these companies are saving 
a huge amount of money in terms of their rent or running costs for an office. Enmployees are getting the benifit of saving huge amounts of time wasted in commute (is that time really wasted?)
But the work that these companies are extracting out of their employees has only got up and their is no professionalism from the bosses. They want their work and will call to you anytime
about that. Now the worst thing is that the new joinees for whom it is very important to know and build a relationship with their colleagues is now non existent, what it feels like is that 
you are working for a computer or a robot who is giving you instructions and deadlines. This is the last thing that you want to do.
<p>Now schools are a bit tricky since people will say that they don't want to send their kids and expose them to the risk of getting infected. Now I would say that their are a 100 other 
ways that they could get infected. But lets leave that topic.
<p>Now this thing called online classes is very easy to bash beacause it has total 0 advantages. All the things that you want from a school are totally dismissed. A good-student teacher
relationship, absent. Heck, student see teacher as a google meet account and nothing else. A place to meet and make friends, nope not here. Some time away from home to learn, explore and enjoy.
No not anymore sir. 
And I can go on for days on the bad things that online classes bring. Schools here are taking full fees but saving huge operating costs. What is this?
parents should get atleast a 50% off on the fees. I see the education system deteriorating in quality because of this online class menace.

<h3>Quitting YouTube for 15 days</h3>
<p>Do you even need a reason to quit watching videos on youtube? 90% of the videos that I watch on youtube is garbage anyways, so whats the point of watching them, and the remaining 10 % is entertainment. Instead I will be investing my time in restarting my channel. I willbe starting wit 15 days as a target but the plan I to get rid of this cheap time killer once and for all. Stay tuned for my new videos on my channel.

<h3>Switched to linux full time</h3>
<p>I was a passionate linux user for quite some time now, 4-5 years maybe. I started it of as a hobby to compile custom kernels and ROMs for my galaxy nexus, so I dual booted my aging pc with windblows and ubuntu. And I never looked back since then, always had a linux machine at my disposal there after. 
When I switched to my new pc, I kept it a single boot system for a long time and had my pentium laptop run linux on it.<p>
All thanks to the corona-chan I dug deeper and deeper into this linux rabbit hole and soon found myself hating to use windows even for small and trivial tasks, the idea was planed in my mind to go linux all-out. So I made up my mind to go linux on my PC as well, and here I am writing this blog on Arch linux with DWM, using vim for writing my blog. But windows still lives in my PC. Because I have other people using this PC as well, and they do not want to give up thier ablility to game on this PC in thier free time, so I had to respect that being an avid pc gamer myself. I will be updating my linux journey as it goes.

<h3>The TCS NQT (No quality test) </h3>
<p>TCS is a company hich is known by every body in India. It's an IT company, just in case you didn't know. So i decided to give its entrance test. My expirience with the dry run check wasn't seemless, but I was expecting the things would be better in the actual exam.
So the day of exam came and I followed all the steps on time, to make sure that I don't mess up anything from my side. Got my exam token 30 mins prior as instructed, and then waited till 12:30 and then when I launched their application for exam boom. Nothing, just a white sceen staring at me. Maybe it will take some time to load. So I waited for 8 mins and still nothing. So I went ahead and decided to quit my launcher and restart it again. Right shift + ESC I pressed and nothing happened. ALT <F4>. Still nothing. Had to resart my machine to get back to their link to generate a new key and I double checked all the instructions and made sure their is no problem from my side. But still nothing started, as soon as I launched the exam, a white screen. Ahaan, I should seek their live chat option for technical help. I went over to the live chat and I am welcomed by a message stating that live chat isn't working rn come back later. I tried 5 times. And then I went to generate the key again, for a last try, but there I was greeted with a message that I have exceeded the start time limit. I wasn't even disappointed.
<p>I was expecting such things in back of my mind, for some reason I don't hold ant Indian IT company with high regard in my mind, TCS maybe a tech giant to others. But for a candidate, they even failed to take a proper online exams, in the work from home mode. 
<p>I did not recieve a reminder mail from them nor did I get any feedback mail. This cements the general consensus among people that TCS is a government-like company. I will be uploading the videos of my expirience to youtube in a while. good day folks.

<h3>Why "Getting over it" is a great game</h3>
<p>Unless you are living under a rock, you know what Getting over it is. Right?. Okay, let me explain a bit, it is a game where you have to darg youreself on top of  mountain to reach to the top and eventually throw youreself up into space. All of this just using a hammer while you are stuck in a pot. 
<p>But the main thing about that game, that stuck me as player is the fact that this game conveys a metaphorical meaning, that is often overlooked by all the streamers and youtubers who are shouting at top of their voices about how frustrating the game is. The game signifies the challenges that we face in life, and how we bail out on some of the difficult challenges, calling them frustrating or impossible. 
<p>The game is designed in such a way that you will fall back to the starting point numerous times, and this is the very reason that a lot of people find it frustrating. But to me, this is the beauty of this game. 
<p>In this age technology has made some of the difficult challenges or tasks look mundane or peice of cake, but when in we are presented the same task without out tech gadgets, we find the same task impossible. This is signified by the characted being stuck in a pot with just a hammer.  
<p>What I especially liked about the game was its voiceover and its difficluty level. And that is posed a real challenge and required a good level of patience and persistence. And these two are the major takeaways from the game, other than the feeling you get when you complete the game and GET OVER IT.

<h3>How I went from loving mobile phones to hating them!</h3>
<p>First things first, I am not an anti-communication guy. By mobile phones I mean to say smartphones and to be more specific the state of smartphones after 2016. With this out of the way lets get started.
<p>I was a big time smarthphone nerd back in the days, I think my interest kindled by the launch of Samsung Galaxy Nexus, I was attracted to the infant andorid OS at that time, because it had a nerdy appeal to it. Anyways, I became the guy to followed phones very passionately. I used to watch a lot of youtube videos and was alway ahead of the curve when it came to smarthphone tech.
<p>I ended up buying a galaxy nexus eventually. I used to mod the hell outta my device, and those were some legit fun times. In the early smarthone days people actually used to talk to each other about the new upcoming phones, new feature and everthing around it. It is safe to say that people used to use their phones as a tools which kept getting better and better. Smarthphones opened up a lot opportunities as well, which were never witnessed before.
<p>Smarthphones got smarter at an exponential rate, the smartphone space soon got saturated with very similar kind of products, and slowly and gradually there was over-abundance of smartphone models. The pace of innovation slowed down. But the smathphone apllications scene just kept getting bigger and bigger. And the problem started here, let me explain with an example from spiderman. I assume that most of the people know what "Venom" from spiderman is. It is an organism that initially increases the power of it's host making them fell more powerful. But slowly and gradually it takes complete control of it's host leaving them as a tool for himself. 
<p>Current state of phones is a true embodiment of Venom. It all started of with smartphones being a tool for us, and now the owner are a tool for the smartphone applications. I it almost impossible to spot a person sitting in a waiting room or a lobby without looking down at his/her moblel. Smartphone is almost always their to take you out of the reality you are living in, and to throw you into the reality of the small screen.

<h3>Why this website?</h3>
<p>The covid lockdown gave me much needed time to sort out my priorities, I had the luxury to truly discover my own thinking and ideologies. Away from other people's thoughts and opinions I thought in a vaccuum about where technology is taking us. I took on anexperiment to try tiling window manager on my linux machine, and i'm glad that I did that. At first I thought about the people who used tiling window managers as wannabe-eletist just for the heck of it, to look cooler, I took the leap and fast forward to august, I am using arch with bspwm on my Linux machine.
<p>It taught me a very important lesson that less is more, the abundance of technology that seems to make things earier for us ends up doing quite the opposite, I realised how easy and simple things saves time and are more efficient in the longer run, I short we all are bloating ourselves when it comes to technology, rather then adding to our abilities, it is taking a toll on us.
<p>One fine day, Luke made a video on how we all should have a personal website, and how this makes a lot more sense instead of using those so called big platforms to express ourselves, I always wanted a place where I could write whatever I want to. So here we are, at my very own personal space, free from all the framework bloat, created only using plain HTML and CSS.
