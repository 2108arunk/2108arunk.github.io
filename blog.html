<h3>How I went from loving mobile phones to hating them!</h3>
<p>First things first, I am not an anti-communication guy. By mobile phones I mean to say smartphones and to be more specific the state of smartphones after 2016. With this out of the way lets get started.
<p>I was a big time smarthphone nerd back in the days, I think my interest kindled by the launch of Samsung Galaxy Nexus, I was attracted to the infant andorid OS at that time, because it had a nerdy appeal to it. Anyways, I became the guy to followed phones very passionately. I used to watch a lot of youtube videos and was alway ahead of the curve when it came to smarthphone tech.
<p>I ended up buying a galaxy nexus eventually. I used to mod the hell outta my device, and those were some legit fun times. In the early smarthone days people actually used to talk to each other about the new upcoming phones, new feature and everthing around it. It is safe to say that people used to use their phones as a tools which kept getting better and better. Smarthphones opened up a lot opportunities as well, which were never witnessed before.
<p>Smarthphones got smarter at an exponential rate, the smartphone space soon got saturated with very similar kind of products, and slowly and gradually there was over-abundance of smartphone models. The pace of innovation slowed down. But the smathphone apllications scene just kept getting bigger and bigger. And the problem started here, let me explain with an example from spiderman. I assume that most of the people know what "Venom" from spiderman is. It is an organism that initially increases the power of it's host making them fell more powerful. But slowly and gradually it takes complete control of it's host leaving them as a tool for himself. 
<p>Current state of phones is a true embodiment of Venom. It all started of with smartphones being a tool for us, and now the owner are a tool for the smartphone applications. I it almost impossible to spot a person sitting in a waiting room or a lobby without looking down at his/her moblel. Smartphone is almost always their to take you out of the reality you are living in, and to throw you into the reality of the small screen.

<h3>Why this website?</h3>
<p>The covid lockdown gave me much needed time to sort out my priorities, I had the luxury to truly discover my own thinking and ideologies. Away from other people's thoughts and opinions I thought in a vaccuum about where technology is taking us. I took on anexperiment to try tiling window manager on my linux machine, and i'm glad that I did that. At first I thought about the people who used tiling window managers as wannabe-eletist just for the heck of it, to look cooler, I took the leap and fast forward to august, I am using arch with bspwm on my Linux machine.
<p>It taught me a very important lesson that less is more, the abundance of technology that seems to make things earier for us ends up doing quite the opposite, I realised how easy and simple things saves time and are more efficient in the longer run, I short we all are bloating ourselves when it comes to technology, rather then adding to our abilities, it is taking a toll on us.
<p>One fine day, Luke made a video on how we all should have a personal website, and how this makes a lot more sense instead of using those so called big platforms to express ourselves, I always wanted a place where I could write whatever I want to. So here we are, at my very own personal space, free from all the framework bloat, created only using plain HTML and CSS.
