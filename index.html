<h2>Software I am currently using</h2>
<hr/>
<h4>Operating System</h4>
I am currently using <a href="https://endeavouros.com/">EndevourOS</a> is an Arch Based Linux distribution, I always prefer using Linux on my personal machines.
I also recommend people to make a switch from Ubuntu to Arch based distributions, there is much more offered here in the Arch world.
<h4>Desktop Environment</h4>
Using <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">bspwm</a>, polybar and sxhkd. Bspwm is a tiling window manager which tiles windows automatically onto the screen.
If you are using Linux and haven't checked out any tiling window manager. I highly recommend trying one. It would feel
like a new way to interact with your computer. It is far more efficient than a traditional desktop environment, and also
looks very cool. :P
<h4>Text editor and IDE</h4>
For smaller tasks and projects is use Neovim. I use a preconfigured version called <a href="https://nvchad.github.io/">Nvchad</a>.
I cannot explain in words the usefulness and extensibility of vim, everyone should spend some time learning vim. 
OSS verison of Vscode is my IDE of choice, but often times when I want to use a GUI text editor I use Geany.
<h3>I recommend having a quick look at the other links before leaving</h3>
