    <h3>Ideology</h3>
    <div style="text-align:justify">
    I am learning to play guitar and I was frustrated when searching for chords shapes online led me to the websites
    that did everything other than showing the guitar chord diagram. So I made this simple and functional website that does what
    it's supposed to do.<br>
    The chord shapes may not be complete and exhaustive, I will be adding more in the future.
    </div>
    <h3>How to read the diagrams</h3>
    The chord diagrams are presented in plain ascii. Each string is represented with its name.<p>
    X - don't play that string<br> 
    O - play the string open<br>
    Numeral (1...) - Play the string from that fret<br>
    As simple as that.
    <h3>Don't even want to open the borwser to check chords? I have got you covered!</h3>
    I have made two command line programs to print chord shapes in the terminal. They are :-
    <h4>chords</h4>
    A posix script that would print out the chord shape whenever and wherever you want.
    <h4>some_chords</h4>
    A C program using ncurses library, can be considered as a fancier version of chords.
