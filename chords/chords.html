    <h3>Ideology</h3>
    I am learning to play guitar and it is so frustrating to search chords shapes online to find websites that do
    everything other than showing the guitar chord diagrams. So I made one for my own.
    <h3>How to read the diagrams</h3>
    The chord diagrams are presented in plain ascii. Each string is represented with its name.
    X - don't play that string 
    O - play the string open
    Numeral (1...) - Play the string from that fret
    As simple as that.
