<h3>Compression Utility in C</h3>
<p>
I wrote a command line in Cutility to perform compression of a data stream by applying the ”move-to-front transform”, followed by Fibonacci coding. 
MTF was implemented using a tree based data structure, and input/output using bit-wise manipulations and the extensive use of pointers.

<h3>Dynamic memory allocator in C</h3>
<p>
Implemented segregated free list allocator for the x86-64 architecture which does free, malloc and realloc. 
Allocator has supports immediate coalescing of blocks on free with adjacent free blocks, boundary tags to support efficient coalescing and free lists maintained using last in first out (LIFO) structure

<h3>Make command Implementation in C</h3>
<p>
Implement a program called cook, that behaves like a simplified version of make, with the ability to run jobs in parallel up to a specified maximum. 
Became familiar with low-level Unix/POSIX system calls related to processes, signal handling, files, and I/O redirection.

<h3>STUDY OF PATH INSTABILITY OF A RISING OIL DROPLET USING PIV [Publication]</h3>
<p>

    This paper presents an experimental study of the dynamics of a rising oil droplet in water. 
    The motion is associated with path, velocity and shape instabilities. 
    In this work, the former two instabilities have been studied. A three-dimensional visualization of the trajectory of the rising droplet has been presented. 
    A stereo-PIV analysis was conducted on the system for visualization of the velocity field generated by the motion of the droplet. 
    Two distinct type of trajectories were observed and the liquid droplet were found to follow two types of paths - straight and zig-zag. 
    Helical paths were not observed in our study. 
    Vorticity plots calculated from the velocity field are used to explain the observed trajectories
