<h3>Chords</h3>
<p>A simple program to print out common guitar chord shapes right in your
terminal. Maybe posix compliant, I am not too sure about that.

<h3>Phetch</h3>
<p>A small little POSIX compliant shell script to print out useful/unuseful
information in your terminal.
<p>Will be expanding this till it's maturity to keep an eye on that!!

<h3>Intelligent Traffic Lights Using Reinforcement Learning</h3>
<p>Distressed with the increasing traffic in my city, I decided to undertake a project that
could have some value in the future. We Started off by conducting literature survey,
soon to discover that there has been some solid work done in the field. We
expanded our research to be more in line with the Indian Traffic conditions and the
results we were able to achieve were significant. We achieved a 74% performance
improvement over a standard traffic light.<br>

<h3>Navigation Bar and Status bar customisation for Android</h3>
<p>These are theme-ing apps that work alongside the Substratum theme engine for
Android to change and customize navigation and status bar of an android device.
I made them possible using guides from the theme community, Android Studio,
GIMP, Adobe Illustrator and JAVA.
The Apps are called “[Substratum] Navigate theme” and “[Substratum] Status
theme”.
“Navigate” theme has crossed 300K downloads on Google Play Store.<br>

<h3>Covid Status Script for my State</h3>
<p>A simple one liner shell script to quickly see the last day stats of covid-19 in my state. The data is fetched from a csv file maintained by the guys at covid19india.org.
